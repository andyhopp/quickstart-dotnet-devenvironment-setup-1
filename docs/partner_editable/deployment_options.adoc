This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of a new VPC, subnets, security groups and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides a template that will, by default, deploy a new VPC. By selecting an existing VPC and subnet IDs, this template will deploy into the selected VPC and subnet.
