As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with a public subnet to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnet, an EC2 Windows instance configured with the following commonly used development tools for .NET applications: Git for Windows, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, the Chocolatey package manager, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and PowerShell Core.

[.small]#* When you launch the Quick Start into an existing VPC (by providing IDs for the VPC and subnet), the template skips the creation of the VPC and subnet.#
