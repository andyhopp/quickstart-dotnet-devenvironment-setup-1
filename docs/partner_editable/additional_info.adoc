== Post-deployment steps
This Quick Start creates an EC2 instance that uses a trial license of JetBrains Rider. If you determnine that you would like to obtain a license or apply an existing license, you will need to follow the instructions on JetBrains' site for https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/buy[purchasing a license] or https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Register.html[registering an existing license].

== Security
This Quick Start deploys an EC2 instance into your AWS environment and configures an EC2 instance with a password that has been encrypted with an EC2 key pair. If you select the deployment option that deploys your EC2 instance to a VPC that is created for you, this instance will be placed into a public subnet to enable access via Remote Desktop Protocol. If this option is selected, it is recommended that you take the additional step of modifying the security group to restrict access to only networks you control by following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-security-groups.html[these steps].

== Other useful information
Although this topic is beyond the scope of this Quick Start, one of the advantages of using an EC2 instance to host development tools is the ability to use the https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/stop-start-instance-scheduler/[AWS Instance Scheduler solution] to automatically shut down the instance outside of office hours.
